# Day 1
* Today I started working on project 3
* I first started with adding jquery to my project by downloading the files from jquery.com. Then I put it into my project js folder and linked it in my index.html file with a script tag also linking my script.js right after.
* I included a text field to reveal the other options from the job role in the index.html file on lines 41-43.
* Then I hid the `other-title` in the script.js file
* I am having trouble with the colors tab so I went back to `https://teamtreehouse.com/library/what-is-traversal` to traverse the DOM with jQuery.

# Day 2
* Today I worked on the design button to change the t-shirt color options.
* I had to research how to select the `value` within the `<options>` tag.
* I used `if` and `else` statements to show and hide the selected t-shirt colors.
* My code was't working as intended so I called my mentor for tips. We used the live share feature in VS Code to accomplish this.

# Day 3
* I worked on the registered activities part of the project.
* I tried many different approaches and wasn't about to successfully disable and enable the proper checkboxes.
* Called my mentor for some help on how I should approach this one alse.
