# Interactive Form
# Day 1
* Today I started working on project 3
* I first started with adding jquery to my project by downloading the files from jquery.com. Then I put it into my project js folder and linked it in my index.html file with a script tag also linking my script.js right after.
* I included a text field to reveal the other options from the job role in the index.html file on lines 41-43.
* Then I hid the `other-title` in the script.js file
* I am having trouble with the colors tab so I went back to `https://teamtreehouse.com/library/what-is-traversal` to traverse the DOM with jQuery.
